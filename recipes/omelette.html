    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 2 large eggs </li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon unsalted butter </li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons grated cheese, any kind </li>
        <li> 3 to 4 cherry tomatoes, cut in half and sprinkled lightly with salt</li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons chopped basil, parsley, or herb of your choice</li> 
    </ul>

    <h2> Directions </h2>
    <ol>
        <li> In a bowl, beat the eggs using a fork. </li>
        <li> Melt the butter using a skillet over medium to low heat. </li>
        <li> 
            <p> Add the eggs to the skillet. Wait until the edges begin to set, then 
            use a spatula to push the edges toward the center and tilt the pan 
            so the uncooked eggs move to the edge.
            </p>

            <p>
                Repeat until eggs are somewhat set with a little softness in the center, about 6 min.

        <li> 
            Place cheese, tomatoes, herbs, and any filling of your choice down the center. 
            Make sure not to overfill.
        </li>
        <li> 
            Cook for about 1 minute longer, then use a spatula to
            slide under the eggs and to carefully fold the omelette.
        </li> 
        <li> Use the spatula to place the omelette on a plate. There you go.</li>
